# Behave
A new implementation of the extended Rothermel model

# Test Mortality Executable
The files are located in /behave/src/testMortality.  In that folder, users will find the "resultsProbMort.csv" which is the result of running the testMortality executable.  It should be deleted or renamed anytime the testMortality executable is run; otherwise, the run will just append to that same file.
